New features (as of 11/15)
- 3D graphical view of stars
- All named stars can be accessed
- For now, the "default" location you are at is the north pole, which is why Polaris is right above you in the sky view. Actual geolocation will come soon.
- Stars have different sizes depending on brightness
- Wikipedia text should be cut off if they are too long
